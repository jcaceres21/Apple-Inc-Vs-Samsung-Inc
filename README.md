## Project Description
How have we ever wondered why so many customers choose either an iPhone
or Samsung as a personal choice, today I’m going to talk about how this information
impacts the type of product that each customer is intrigued to buy and the reason
behind it.

### Question of Interest 
- Analyze quarterly or annual sales reports to track the performance of Apple and
Samsung smartphones.?
- Identify any shifts in market share and investigate the reasons behind these changes
-  Conduct surveys or analyze online discussions to understand consumer preferences for
Apple and Samsung smartphones.

### Importance Statement 
These Question are *especially* **Important** because 
1. The decision is impacted because of the style and price that the company puts out there when
releasing a new phone, for example, many customers don't like paying for apps like the iPhone
while Samsung provides it for free, or because it provides that slick design that hooks young
people for the looks. In the data, we can see that in 2017 and 2018 Samsung did so much
better in sales and revenue than Apple and it shows that having those free apps impacts a lot
on sales.

2. Samsung is well recognized by the Samsung Galaxy Brand which includes the Samsung
Galaxy S series which was first produced in 2010, while Apple is well known as the first
successful personal computer company. With this much influence and the history that this
company provides, it helps to see the customer's preference or Brand perception and
sometimes it can be for brand loyalty.

3. I decided to do a survey on these two companies and see whether the females or males are more attracted to
Apple or Samsung, but also identifying the different types of ages that many of these people are
either buying or changing their preference to another phone.

### Data Desccription & Upload 

- In order to access the data for the vizualization, you will need to click the link that is provided above and its going to take you directly to Tableuo Public, there you can see the original graphs and the data that would be provide for you.
- The raw data would be provide as well to see the specification and details of what the data is about, the name of the file is Apple Vs. Smasung.xlx
- The data types would be Apple and Samsung  and the columns represent Geography,product,unit sales, revenue and brand.
- Laslty the other data that is in excel is the Survey that I conduct to see the Participants ID which is the number of survey I conducted, next is age, location and brand preference.

- The figure above it shows how each company did between the years 2017 and 2018, this influence the data due to how the company is marketing their products or the new features that the phone provides like using the fingerprint to help you unlock your phone which is the Samsung feature, then just the basic slide-up and putting your password. During the 2018 sales, we discovered that Apple did better selling the iPhone in the USA than the Rest of Pacific Asia and this is because of the early adoption of technology that in 2018 many countries were not ready to embrace a new technology. The last difference in revenue that each of these companies has is the cost of building the new phone and technology integrated to be the best mobile device to be used daily. This Visualisation helped me answer my question because it demonstrate how each company did yearly but also who had the most sales during that year and the reason behind it.

-In the figure above we can see the difference in the market between these two companies and the most important key that would determine how the market trend changes are due to the prices of each of these phones, Believe it or not, many customers may like the look of the new mobiles devices but if many customers can’t afford to buy an expensive iPhone or Samsung, then we can see the shift of the market and how much Units of Sales that the company is selling each year. This visualization answers my question because it helps me to see what each company needs to improve on or the type of changes in prices of each country influence the market selling of the devices for example where in Europe the iPhone is far more expensive than in the US because of the currency difference.
