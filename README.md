# Apple-Inc-Vs-Samsung-Inc
Author: Joshua Caceres (jcaceres@elon.edu)

## Project Description
How have we ever wondered why so many customers choose either an iPhone
or Samsung as a personal choice, today Iâ€™m going to talk about how this information
impacts the type of product that each customer is intrigued to buy and the reason
behind it.

### Question of Interest 
- Analyze quarterly or annual sales reports to track the performance of Apple and
Samsung smartphones.?
- Identify any shifts in market share and investigate the reasons behind these changes
-  Conduct surveys or analyze online discussions to understand consumer preferences for
Apple and Samsung smartphones.

### Importance Statement 
These Question are *especially* **Important** because 
1. The decision is impacted because of the style and price that the company puts out there when
releasing a new phone, for example, many customers don't like paying for apps like the iPhone
while Samsung provides it for free, or because it provides that slick design that hooks young
people for the looks. In the data, we can see that in 2017 and 2018 Samsung did so much
better in sales and revenue than Apple and it shows that having those free apps impacts a lot
on sales.
